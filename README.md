Angular/Ionic Expenses App


Opens on Overview. 2 tabs at bottom to switch between overview and viewing stored receipts.


Overview:

Displays a running total of receipts. The number of receipts that have been claimed or remain unclaimed and a total value of the receipts.


Add Receipt:

Add a new receipt with date, description, amount and the option to add a picture of the receipt by either taking a photo or selecing a file from the gallery.

*Taking a photo will save it to the gallery but I wasn't able to recall the pictures when viewing receipts. I have issues getting firebase to install and am not able to run firebase init, tried manually setting up the files but I'm still not able to use any firebase commands.


View Receipts:

Displays a list of all the saved receipts which can be filtered on between which have been claimed and which remain unclaimed. Clicking into a receipt and show details and attached photo/image and has a button to switch the receipt to claimed or unclaimed as well as a delete button to remove the receipt.
